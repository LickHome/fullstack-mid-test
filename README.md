# FullStack Mid Test

### The Challenge
The challenge is split into two parts. Depending on where your strengths lay feel free to tackle 1 or both of the tasks.

#### BE Task
Create a custom rest API to pre-filter all required data needed. The required data includes getting all Alive, Rick characters along with one or more of their associated data types Origin, Location and or Episode data.

The interfaces in the codebase will show you what the data structure **must** look like, if you need to extend them, feel free! However, the original structure must be preserved.

#### FE Task
Build a simple UI to list all characters using the mockdata provided and using the basic wireframes provided. There is mockdata for the character listing page and for the individual character page. The pages themselves have been added. 

##### Please ensure your work checks all the points below â€“ itâ€™s what we will be looking out for

- Your chosen method for fetching and aggregating data.
- Chosen folder structure
- The layout should be based on the wireframes provided.
- Final work (whether complete or part complete) should be submitted in a git repository. (ideally we would like to see a commit history of some sort). With a README.md file, so we can run the app locally and test it ourselves.
- **DO NOT use the Rick and Morty JavaScript library**. We want to see how you architect aggregating data server side to pass it to the frontend.
- The site should be built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript (TypeScript), and as far as styling is concerned: SCSS, Pre/Post CSS, CSS Modules, and CSS-in-JS are all encouraged.
- The site should be built using responsive techniques.
- **YOU MUST** use the boilerplate provided.

### Taking things further:
(Not a requirement but if you think it will help us assess your skill level and passion).  If you have the time, here are some suggestions to enhance the app:

- Include Alive Morty characters (it is Rick and Morty at the end of the day - ðŸ˜†)
- Use path aliases
- Introduce a build pipeline using Github CI / Circle CI or other CI tools.
- Responsive images
- Unit tests
- Performance optimisation (add a cache layer)
